It’s a cold, wet and rainy day on Dec 30, 2020 where we start our journey. Having stayed up till 1am yesterday watching a TV series, I’m pretty tired and don’t really want to do any work. But here we are, and here life is, in a world constantly moving forwards that we’ll be left behind if we stayed where we were. My task for the upcoming year is to get accepted as a software engineer intern at Google (preferably, but any FAANG will do) for Summer 2021, so let’s get started!
