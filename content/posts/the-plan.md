I have a couple of days before winter break ends, so our first mission is to 1) Make a battle plan and 2) Set up this blog.
### Making a battle plan.
Here's a quick sketch up of a timeline:

### Setting up this blog.
  
  I had a boring rainy afternoon, and decided to set up this blog using Hugo for static website generation, and Netlify for free hosting and deployment. Because the site pages are static, specifically displaying the same information to all users, creating a static site doesn't require much programming skills. New content is written in `Markdown` or `HTML`, which is like regular writing with extra tags. However, one will need a basic understanding of Git and the command line. There are 3 steps in total:
   
  **1. Create site with Hugo**

  I followed the [Hugo quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to set up a static site using the theme [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/). Most of the creation process was very straightforward, the only tricky bit was having to rename `config.toml` to `config.yml` because the PaperMod documentation used YML whereas the original site generated by Hugo had TOML, and I had no urge to convert between these languages.

  **2. Add project to GitHub**

  The next step was to add my website to Git.  I [started a new git repository](https://kbroman.org/github_tutorial/pages/init.html), and committed and pushed the existing project files.

  **3. Deploy site to Netlify**

  Finally, the website required a hosting and deployment service. There are [tons of different choices](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/) out there, but I ultimately chose Netlify because it is free, and Hugo + Netlify is a very popular combo.

  To set up Netlify, I followed Hugo's [Host on Netlify](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/) documentation. For the Netlify config file, I kept it pretty simple, remembering to replace the `HUGO_VERSION` with my own version, which can be found using `hugo version` on the command line.

  *netlify.toml:*
  ```
  # Build commands
  [build]
  publish = "public"   # output directory, `public` by default
  command = "hugo"

  # Production
  [context.production.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.80.0"
    HUGO_ENV = "production"
    HUGO_ENABLEGITINFO = "true"

  # Testing
  [context.deploy-preview.environment]
    HUGO_VERSION = "0.80.0"
  ```
  Ta-da! Site is now live at [https://jels-code-journey.netlify.app/](https://jels-code-journey.netlify.app/). I'm actually very impressed with Hugo + Netlify, compared with other free options like Jekyll + GitHub Pages which I previously tried. In development, the site loads new changes without me having to refresh the page, and the deployment process is super fast and responsive. Highly recommend this for any blog or personal website if you're just looking for a simple way to publish content.
