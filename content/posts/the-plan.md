I have a couple of days before winter break ends, so our first mission is to **1)** Make a battle plan and **2)** Set up this blog. 
### Making a battle plan.
Here's a quick sketch up of a timeline:

### Setting up this blog.
   
   I had a free rainy afternoon, and followed the [Hugo quick start guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) to set up a static blog using the theme [PaperMod](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-papermod/). Most of it was very straightforward, the only tricky bit was having to rename `config.toml` to `config.yml` because the PaperMod documentation used YML whereas the original template had TOML, and I had no urge to convert between these languages.

   Next, I needed a hosting and deployment service. There are [tons of different choices](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/) out there, but I ultimately chose Netlify because it is free, and Hugo + Netlify is the most popular combo.
